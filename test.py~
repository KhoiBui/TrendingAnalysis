    Inconsistent:
    - Two leads for one project, separated by "/" E.g. "Adam/Monika"
    - Batch name sometimes not included under "Project Information"
    - Customer name is sometimes the site name, other times it is
      site name + entity
    - Different formatting/spelling of go live date E.g. "GO date" or
      "Go live date" or "Go-Live date"
    - Detail of Findings table is sometimes 2nd from last table or 3rd
      from last
        - some reports have extra color code table at the end

    Consistent:
    - Batch name is always 3rd non-empty line in document
    - followed by lead's name
    - followed by report date
    - SAP ID
    - "Project Stakeholders" section follows the same order
    - Detail of Findings table have consistent header
