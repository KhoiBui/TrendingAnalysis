# Trending Analysis
The Standards Compliance team at IGT compiles a spreadsheet of various metrics from software projects each month. This allows managers to observe trends as they develop and help to identify problematic process areas and their causes. Getting the data for trending analysis is a very manual task that involves extracting certain pieces of information in Final CAPA Reports and putting them into a spreadsheet. This program attempts to automate as much of that process as possible.
